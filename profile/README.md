### Introduction
CollabB or CollabBee is as for now, a virtual organization. An online incubator lab for social product development.

# collabb
Collaborative Online Incubator For Product Development

## The working question
Can we make a distributed autonomous organization from scratch that produces a new product from idea till market launch? 

This project is coming into being.  It doesn't have code yet, the skeleton is in the making. If you want to know more visit the landing pages. They are both under development.

### Background
CollabB or CollabBee can be both used, it is a thought and real experiment that tests out collaboration under different rules.
Most ideas, that are listed under CollabB have a hollistic approach to mainstream challenges or narratives. CollabB is part of Makea a small startup with a ethics first approach. 
The idea started off as a little joke, and a thirst for real experiments and research that doesn't manipulate the outcome.
Although we bias towards a better society and trustbuilding relationships, the project is not political. Does not favor any opinion, except that of
character and personality type. We create a world according to our choices. Creativity thrives under constraints.

The project is long term. The license will be determined in a later stage.
